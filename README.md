Movie Rating Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict movie ratings based on key features such as genre, runtime, director, cast, budget, release year, and user reviews. The project focuses on identifying patterns in historical movie data and building predictive models to estimate audience ratings accurately.

The workflow includes data cleaning, handling missing values, feature encoding, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and correlations. Multiple machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model for rating prediction.

This project helps streaming platforms, production houses, and viewers assess a movie’s potential success and audience reception.
